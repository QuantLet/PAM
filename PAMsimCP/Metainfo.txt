Description: ‘Performs the Penalized Adaptive Method (PAM), a combination of propagation-separation approach and a SCAD penalty, to fit a model to a simulated data with a pre-defined change point. Computes the percentage of correctly identified change points over a specified number of scenarios.’

Keywords: ‘linear model, regression, SCAD penalty, bic, change point, simulations, bootstrap’
